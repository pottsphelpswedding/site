We don’t really remember how we first initially met but all we know is that we became instant best friends. We most likely connected due to our weirdness and sense of humor. We spent our middle school sleep overs hacking people’s emails and trying to become YouTube famous. We spent most nights on the phone quizzing each other for upcoming tests. We were both high achievers in school and awfully competitive when it came to comparing our grades.
