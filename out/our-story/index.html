Greg and I first had a thing in art class in the 5th grade. I remember his random acts of kindness such as bringing me paint and my ceramic fish. After the 5th grade Greg moved away. We texted on and off the years in-between until our final reconnection in the 10th grade. Our first date in the 10th grade was a high-school basketball game, followed by bowling the next week.</p><p>And now I would like to thank our Mothers for driving us every single Friday for years to see each other (we didn’t have our licenses or cars yet)!</p><p>After high school we went to Hiram College in Ohio together. We both chose to not live on campus, but to commute from our homes.</p><p>Now how did we end up in South Carolina?? My parents had always talked about moving to South Carolina for retirement to escape the Ohio weather. So, since the start of our relationship Greg and I have always been in agreeance to move South for similar reasons – but we never knew when or if this was ever really going to happen. My parents decided life was too short and that they weren’t going to wait until retirement to move to SC.</p><p>It felt like I was given a 6-month eviction notice from the house I grew up in, and everything just seemed to fall into place and we just moved with them. The timeframe of the move was perfect for us. Greg had recently graduated college and I had finished my pre-requisites for pharmacy school.</p><p>The proposal: On our 6th dating anniversary we went out to dinner at the Peddler Steakhouse. Greg was convinced the whole night that I knew he had a ring (I didn’t know). He cut the pocket on the inside of his suit jacket bigger to try to conceal it better. After dinner it was late and dark outside. We walked out the door and were heading to the car to go home. A few steps outside the door I remember him saying, “Come here I have something for you.” He then got down on one knee and popped the question. I was so shocked that I’m pretty sure I never even said the word “YES.” I didn’t get to see the ring until we got into the car and he turned the light on.</p><p>Months following our engagement we still did not even know what year we were going to get married. At first we talked about waiting until I was out of school (2021), but that just seemed too far away. So then we were saying 2020. Finally, 10 months after the engagement we realized that there was no reason for us to wait any longer so October 5, 2019 it is!</p></main><footer style="text-align:center"><span>© <!-- -->2019</span></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/our-story","query":{},"buildId":"v8tWDDfd~Xo21FfmX2vwF","nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/our-story" src="/_next/static/v8tWDDfd~Xo21FfmX2vwF/pages/our-story.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/v8tWDDfd~Xo21FfmX2vwF/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-838b392324e3598684b5.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.a33dbe08d96f900005fe.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/styles.86d5acee9c4b946d4660.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-fadd4b02cfdf93752da4.js" async=""></script></body></html>
